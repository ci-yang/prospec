# Archive Summary Format Reference

This document defines the expected format for `summary.md`, generated by the **prospec-archive** Skill when archiving completed changes.

## Purpose

`summary.md` is a concise record of a completed change, capturing its intent, scope, quality, and traceability for future reference.

---

## Standard Format

```markdown
# {change-name} — Archive Summary

- **Archived**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Original Created**: {created date from metadata.yaml}
- **Quality Grade**: {S / A / B / C / D / Unverified}
```

### 2. User Story Summary

Extract from `proposal.md`:

```markdown
## User Story

As a [role],
I want [feature],
So that [value].
```

---

### 3. Affected Modules

Extract from `delta-spec.md`, listing all modules with changes:

```markdown

If affected modules have AI Knowledge documentation:

```markdown
## Knowledge Update

The following module documentation may need updating:
- `{{knowledge_base_path}}/modules/{module}/README.md`
```

## File Length Guidelines

- Keep under **80 lines**
- Focus on traceability and searchability, not detailed implementation notes
