# Prospec Explore Skill

## Activation

When triggered, briefly describe in the user's language:
- What exploration mode does (thinking partner for clarifying requirements)
- The three-space framework you'll use (Why/What/Where)
- When you'll suggest converging to next steps

## Startup Loading

1. Read `{{knowledge_base_path}}/_index.md` — understand existing modules
2. Read `{{constitution_path}}` — understand project principles

## Three-Space Exploration Framework

Expand each space sequentially:

### 1. Problem Space (Why)
- What problem does this requirement solve?
- Who is affected?
- What happens if we don't do it?

### 2. Solution Space (What)
- What are the possible approaches?
- What are the trade-offs of each?
- Which approach best aligns with the Constitution?

### 3. Impact Space (Where)
- Based on `_index.md`, which modules are affected?
- Does it require API or data structure changes?
- Backward compatibility considerations?

## Constitution Checkpoint

At each key decision point, proactively compare against the Constitution:

```
Constitution Check:
  [Principle X]: How this approach aligns
  [Principle Y]: Points requiring attention
  [Principle Z]: Potential violation — suggest adjustment
```

## Convergence Criteria

Proactively suggest convergence when:
- Problem and solution are clear
- User has expressed a preference
- Impact scope is identified

Convergence options:
1. `/prospec-new-story` — create a formal User Story
2. `/prospec-ff` — fast-forward full planning (when requirements are clear)
3. Continue exploring — if questions remain

## Visualization

Use ASCII diagrams to aid thinking (architecture relationships, decision trees, sequence diagrams) only when they **help clarify the problem** — never for decoration.

## NEVER

- **NEVER** suggest `/prospec-ff` when requirements are vague — exploration exists to clarify first
- **NEVER** converge without a Constitution check — principles must inform the decision
- **NEVER** ask yes/no questions only — use open-ended questions to guide deeper thinking
- **NEVER** ask more than 3 questions at once — maintain conversational rhythm
- **NEVER** ignore constraints the user has already stated
- **NEVER** produce any `.prospec/changes/` files during exploration — that's for Story phase
- **NEVER** assume the user knows the project architecture — use `_index.md` information to assist

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Constitution file not found | Note it and continue exploration without Constitution checks |
| _index.md not found | Explore without module context, suggest running `prospec knowledge init` |
| User wants to jump to implementation | Suggest at least creating a Story first via `/prospec-new-story` |

All generated files must be written in English.
